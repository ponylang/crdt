# crdt

Conflict-free replicated data types for Pony.

## Building and Testing

```bash
make                    # build tests + examples (release)
make test               # same as above
make config=debug       # debug build
make build-examples     # examples only
make clean              # clean build artifacts + corral cache
```

## Project Status

**Current state**: Early development. Project structure is in place but core CRDT types are not yet implemented.
